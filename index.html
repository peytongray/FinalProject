  <h1> The Disparities </h1>
  <body>Among the many inequalities women face due to their gender, the prejudice toward reproductive rights and women's right to choose what they do with their bodies is one of the more controversial and important.
      
 <p> Many countries have different laws as to the legality of abortion. In America, there are few restrictions and a reason is not needed as to why a woman gets an abortion. However, in places like Argentina, Mexico, and India, there are restrictions to abortion including the health of the mother and socioeconomic reasons. </p>
