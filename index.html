  <h1 id="effect"> The Effect of Abortion Laws </h1>
    <body><p id="p1">Among the many inequalities women face due to their gender, the prejudice toward reproductive rights and women's right to choose what they do with their bodies is one of the more controversial and important. Men have always been in the position to pass legislation restricting women's right to choose. However, women deserve the right to choose what happens to their bodies, no matter the circumstances.</p>
      
 <p id="p2"> Many countries have different laws as to the legality of abortion. In America, there are few restrictions and a reason is not needed as to why a woman gets an abortion. However, in places like Argentina, Mexico, and India, there are restrictions to abortion including the health of the mother and socioeconomic reasons. Through years of research by medical professionals, I have come to a conclusion through this small amount of research. In countries with strict or restrictive abortion laws, more women die of abortion related deaths, whereas in countries without tough restrictions, fewer women lose their lives. If countries would put aside political issues and religious beliefs, they could save the lives of countless women who die senselessly. </p>
