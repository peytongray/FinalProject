        <p>Many of the sources I found were from a trusted Centre College approved Database such as Statista, R3Data, and government sites such as the CDC. I trust that these are legitimate sources as they were provided by credible librarians and fact-checked websites. The data contained in these links can be separated into two categories: US elections/partisanship and how the legal status of abortion worldwide affects abortion-related deaths. </p>
