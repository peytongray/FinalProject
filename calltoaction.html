        <p id="disclaimer">This data includes countries with differing abortion laws that have available data. Many countries are incredibly private about their abortion statistics, or even downplay the numbers. </p>
    
        <p id="argument">Notice that when the data is sorted by death rates that the abortion laws seem to sort as well. The highest amount of deaths occur when abortion is prohibited altogether, followed by abortion laws to save a woman's life, preserve physical health, preserve mental health, and socioeconomic grounds. The least amount of deaths occur when there are no restrictions as to reason for an abortion. Just looking at this small snippet of data shows this very important, life-saving pattern.</p>
        
        <p id="call">Countries must change their legislation in order to loosen their stringent abortion laws. This is an important fact in order to save the lives of countless women who should be able to choose to have an abortion or not.</p>
